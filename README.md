SQL Challenge Assignment using Postgres

#Background
This is your first SQL-challenge assigment since two weeks you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). 
Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. 
All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

There's three steps to perform in this project
**1. Data Modeling**
**2. Data Engineering**
**3. Data Analysis**

## Notes
All files are inside the folder named `EmployeeSQL`. This folder contains:

* A `data` folder that contains the six CSV files.

* An `images` folder that contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD).

* An `employee_db_tbl_create.sql` file that contains the table creation script for the six tables.

* An `employee_db_queries.sql` file that contains the queries created to answer the questions under *Data Analysis* below.

## Data Engineering

The 6 CSV files inside the data folder were inspected and ERD was created which can found inside the images folder. 
The ERD is the first step to study the data, design the table schema and its relationship with other tables.
